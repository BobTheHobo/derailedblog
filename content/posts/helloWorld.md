Oh my gosh, hello! 

Welcome you to derailed, a blog and personal outlet to share my musings with the world and to carve out my own little corner of the internet.

As per the name, the content here will be extremely varied. Here, you'll find everything tutorials and thoughts to opinion pieces and informative articles that will hopefully pique your interest.

Whether you're looking for a distraction or seeking thought-provoking content, I hope that derailed will deliver.

Join me on this journey and see where it takes us. Enjoy the ride!
